# Machine Learning-based üß† Prediction Model for Battery Levelsüîãin IoT devices using Meteorological Variables üå¶Ô∏è 

Efficient energy management is vital for the sustainability of IoT devices employing solar harvesting systems, particularly to circumvent battery deple-
tion during periods of diminished solar incidence. Embracing the structured methodology of CRISP-DM, this study introduces machine learning (ML)
models that utilise meteorological data to predict battery charge levels in solar-powered IoT devices. These models enable proactive adjustments to
the devices‚Äô data sampling frequencies, ensuring effective energy utilisation. The proposed ML models were evaluated using authentic battery charge data
and weather forecast records. The empirical results of this study corroborate the predictive prowess of the models, with an average accuracy reaching as
high as 94.09% in specific test cases. This substantiates the potential of the developed methodology to significantly enhance the energy autonomy of IoT
devices through predictive analytics.
